This is a javascript based tool to calculate simple model solutions. It plots a time series and a phase space trajectory for 3 variables after pushing
the blue button. Next developments should contain: 
  - further examples for models of different problems and issues.
  - debugging of applicants.
  - review and improvements of plotly-code to decrease datastorage and to enable more calculation steps
